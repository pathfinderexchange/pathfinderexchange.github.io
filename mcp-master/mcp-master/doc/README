MCP Quick Start Guide.

1. Install dependencies.
   1.1. memcached (version 1.1 or higher)
   1.2. Perl modules
      1.2.1. IO::Epoll
      1.2.2. Tie::Syslog
      1.2.3. String::CRC32
      1.2.4. Data::UUID
      1.2.5. Mime::Base64::URLSafe
      1.2.6. Cache::Memcached

2. Install MCP.
   2.1. Install contents of lib/ directory into your perl library path.
   2.2. Install contents of bin/ directory into any executable path.
   2.3. Copy conf/default-config.pl to whichever directory you'd like to 
        use for mcp config.
   2.4. Copy and rename conf/config-dist.pl to whichever directory 
        you'd like to use for mcp config, rename to mcp-config.pl.

3. Start Your memecached Instances.  Remember which IPs and ports they're
   running on.

4. Configure MCP.  (Edit the mcp-config.pl file)

   4.1. Basic server configuration:
      4.1.1. At the top, set the #include path to your defalt-config.pl file.
      4.1.2. In the 'server' block, set the user, group, error log 
             destination directory.  You can also adjust how many worker
             processes to run here (default 1 per core).
      4.1.3. In the 'listeners' block, set the IP and port numbers for 
             your administrative port and user request port to listen on.
      4.1.4. In the 'requests' block, set the default_host value to the 
             hostname that should be used when a request does not send any
             Host: header.
      4.1.5. In the 'cache_server' block, set the 'memcached_servers'
             value to be a semicolon-delimited list of IP:port numbers of
             all the memcached instances in your cluster.
      4.1.6. In the 'logger' block, set a log_host_ip and log_host_port,
             or remove the 'Logger' RequestModule from the 
             'request_module_sequence' block futher above for no logging. 

   4.2. Origin server configuration:
      4.2.1. In the 'origin_pools' block (under 'forwarder'), create named 
             arrayrefs for each origin server pool.  Each pool member 
             should be a string containing IP:port number.
      4.2.2. In the 'pool_match' block (under 'forwarder'), create pairings
             of regular expressions and pool names.  When requests come in
             and their URLs match a regular expression on the list, the 
             named origin pool will be used to forward the request, if it
             can't be served from cache.

5. Test.
   5.1. Attempt to start mcpd:

        /path/to/mcpd -d -f /path/to/mcp-config.pl -p /path/to/pidfile

        Daemon should start up, fork children, leave PID in /path/to/pidfile.

   5.2. Send an HTTP request to the listen IP address and port number you
        specified in the configuration file.
